      "Growing up, making art has always been a passion of mine. Basically, since I could hold a crayon, I started the journey into a career of being an artist. Throughout high school I would take every art and computer course available, even taking summer courses for drawing and creating computer games.",
      "Falling into a construction job after high school that lasted for 4 years. That was the pivotal part of my life. Not being able to create everyday really took a toll on me and I had the realization that I had to find a career that better fit me, so I went back to school for 3D animation and modeling.",
      "Since then I got to work on TV shows for huge companies like Disney, Nickelodeon, Hasbro, and Lego. During this time I had dipped my toe into freelance, where I was able to work for some amazing clients like Google, The Royal Canadian Mint and Wizards Of the Coast for both DND and Magic: The Gathering.",
